<p>Businesses facilitated digital initiatives to face the challenges brought by the onset of COVID-19 pandemic to customer- and employee-facing processes. One of these efforts is e-signatures.</p>



<p>E-signatures are becoming more widely accepted around the world, and the <a href="https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/digital-signature-market-177504698.html">digital signature market</a> is expected to grow from $4.0 billion in 2021 to $16.8 billion by 2026. As a result, its application in the sector and other areas is expanding.</p>



<h3><strong>Time-Saving</strong></h3>



<p>Paper-based systems are tedious, time-consuming and error-prone. Traditionally, you’d have to print, scan, and deliver documents to collect signatures.</p>



<p>Software like INHUBBER offers digital signature services so you can save time. For example, INHUBBER lets you sign files in any format like PDF, Excel, MP4, JPEG, Word and more. It also documents any contract change for transparency. Such software simplifies the time-consuming processes of physical document signing, storage and exchange since everything is stored digitally. On top of this, mobility constraints are out of the picture since all parties and businesses can quickly access and sign documents.<br>Another way that digital signature services save time is that it reduces the risk of lost documents. This will save you and your employees from unnecessary tasks such as recovering or retrieving important files when it could be avoided.</p>



<p>Lastly, It is easier to follow-up on the signers. You may check the status of the signature process virtually. Some digital signature services even allow sending of reminders to the signers.</p>



<h3><strong>Efficient</strong></h3>



<p>Digital signatures expedite document processing, allowing you and your employees to complete other tasks. For example, several signatures from a variety of people are required during a sales process. This administrative burden can hamper the sale and even cause the contract to be canceled entirely. If done manually using the traditional paper system, this lengthy procedure may lead to a loss of sale.</p>



<p>Since it’s a cloud-based system, you may even integrate it with your other existing systems to streamline data transfer. For instance, speed up disbursement and approval of salaries in your <a href="https://financesonline.com/top-15-payroll-management-software-systems/">payroll software for accountants</a> by connecting it with your digital signature tool.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Furthermore,your company saves money without having to allot budget for the following:</p>



<ul><li>Paper expenses &#8211; The traditional way of signing papers will require paper and even ink for printers.</li><li>Shipping costs &#8211; If your client cannot visit your office, then you will have to shoulder the shipping of the document.</li></ul>



<h3><strong>Secure and Legal</strong></h3>



<p>Frauds and theft in a company have been an alarming dilemma. According to the <a href="https://www.acfe.com/report-to-the-nations/2020/">2020 ACFE report to the nations</a>, 43% of occupational fraud were detected by a tip. The data show the seriousness of the incidents, which accounts for the greater security of your business’ property.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a company owner and partner, it is a tasking job to upgrade the cybersecurity of your data. Scams and cyber crimes often happen by duplicating identification access to acquire confidential files. This is why digital signature providers assure the <a href="https://inhubber.com/en/news/legal-validity-of-digital-signatures-copy/">legal validity of digital signatures &#8211; 2021</a></p>



<p>INHUBBER follows the eIDAS regulation that uniformly regulates the exchange of electronic signatures. It also includes a blockchain system which records information transactions and prevents it from hacking and cheating the system. To attain the total legality of your e-sign, you must fulfill the requirements of the said regulation.</p>



<p>Moreover, digital signatures include an encryption process which means, it can easily detect the signer and who attempts to use it illegally, especially in B2B transactions.</p>



<h3><strong>Client-centric</strong></h3>



<p>E-signatures can make you work remotely and reach your clients quickly. The importance of digital signature is also experienced in various industries. One of these is the <a href="https://inhubber.com/en/news/legal-validity-of-digital-signatures/">real estate market</a></p>



<p>Signing contracts and agreements is a long process in this sector as there are a lot of considerations, terms, and leases to make.</p>



<p>Using INHUBBER makes the process convenient and secure when renting properties to private or corporate clients. If contracts are sent as a PDF and the tenant inserts his electronic signature as an image, there is a possibility for the court not to honor this as an evidence. INHUBBER provides a secure way of signing contracts digitally with its strong identification procedure which lessens the possibility of a reversal of the burden of proof.</p>



<p>Furthermore, by using digital signature software like INHUBBER, record-keeping will be made easier with the audit trail reducing the possibility of misplacing or losing files.</p>



<div class="wp-container-2 wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container"></div></div>



<h2><strong>Sign up for betterment&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Apart from the tangible economic impact to your company, digitizing signature processes also contribute to keeping the environment better with reduced paper use.<br><br>Spare your company from theft and reduce your workload. Because transactions and crimes are becoming more technologically driven, now is the time to upgrade your cyber security. Make your signature digital by utilizing a reputable digital signature software.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://inhubber.com/en/">INHUBBER signature can sign any file format &#8211; Excel spreadsheets, videos, photos, but also zip folders in a GDPR compliant manner.</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the Regulation on Electronic Identification and Trust Services for Electronic Transactions in the Internal Market of the European Union &#8211; in short: eIDAS Regulation, the exchange of digital signatures has been uniformly regulated throughout the EU since 2016. The eIDAS Regulation entered into force on 8 August 2014 through publication in the Official Journal of the EU. Businesses can benefit from the advantages of digital signatures within the EU.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The eIDAS Regulation specifies which requirements must be fulfilled technically in order for an electronic signature to be legally secure. Only the term electronic signature is legally defined in the eIDAS Regulation. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">eIDAS recommends that companies that need a high level of security in their digital transactions and information exchange use advanced or qualified electronic signatures. This is because it is the only type of signature that has the same legal value as a handwritten signature.</span></p>
<h4><b>What types of electronic signature are there?</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are 3 types of electronic signatures: the simple, the advanced and the qualified electronic signature. According to European law, the simple and the advanced signature allow the text form. A simple electronic signature can be used to sign around 80 percent of all contracts. The difference between the simple and the advanced digital signature is that with the simple signature you do not have to prove your identity. With the advanced signature, the signatory must identify and register himself and two-factor authentication is required.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A qualified signature is required for fixed-term contracts such as employment contracts and tenancy agreements, which must be made in writing according to the law. It has the same legal effect as a handwritten signature. This can be achieved with a video-ident procedure, for example.</span></p>
<h3><b>Simple electronic signatures (EES)</b></h3>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Text form within the meaning of §126b BGB</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Admissible in court</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Very easy to use</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">One-factor authentication</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_electronic_signature"><b>Advanced electronic signatures (FES)</b></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is uniquely assigned to the signatory.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">It enables the identification of the signatory.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is created using electronic signature creation data that only the signer can use.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is linked to the data in such a way that a subsequent change is visible.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">It complies with text form as defined by §126b BGB and is admissible in court.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">It offers increased security through two-factor authentication.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Integrity and authenticity are guaranteed if the requirements for FES are met. FES may not be legally rejected just because they are in electronic form. Properly implemented FES are equivalent to a traditional handwritten signature. If the validity of FES is questioned, the burden of proof lies with the signatory.</span></p>
<h3><a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualifizierte_elektronische_Signatur"><b>Qualified electronic signatures (QES)</b></a></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A QES is an advanced electronic signature created by a &#8220;qualified signature creation device&#8221; and based on a qualified certificate for electronic signatures. The technical requirements for QES are much higher. You have to be certified as a provider. A qualified certificate can only be obtained from a certification authority that is accredited as a Qualified Trust Service Provider (QTSP).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the eIDAS requirements, the system must ensure, among other things, that:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Signature creation data is unique and may only occur once.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Signature creation data cannot be derived with sufficient certainty and are securely protected against forgery.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Signature creation data can be securely protected by the legitimate signatory against use by others.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The generation or management of electronic signature-creation-data on behalf of a signatory may only be performed by a qualified trust service provider.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">only qualified trust service providers may manage electronic signature creation data.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The QES corresponds to the written form as defined in § 126 BGB (German Civil Code) and has the same legal effect as a handwritten signature. Thus, the QES has an increased probative value in court and performs an ID verification by TSP (electronic trust services).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">EU Member States are obliged to recognise the validity of a QES created with a qualified certificate from another Member State. Furthermore, a QES is a legal equivalent to a handwritten signature.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>The Qualified Electronic Signature is only required for</strong>:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fixed-term employment contracts</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tenancy agreements for a fixed term or with graduated rent</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Notices of termination and termination agreements </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agreements on post-contractual non-competition clauses</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">To date, there are contracts that cannot be signed digitally by law.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contracts that cannot be digitally signed include those that can only be signed before a notary.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Examples of these contracts are:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Handwritten will</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Acquisition of real estate</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Termination of an employment contract</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Which digital signature should be used for which type of contract?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simply put, everything that is limited in time (employment contracts, tenancy agreements) or notices of termination and termination agreements cannot be signed with the simple or advanced electronic signature. All other contracts can be signed with the advanced signature.</span></p>
<h3><a href="https://inhubber.com/en/news/legal-validity-of-digital-signatures/"><b>With the INHUBBER signature, GDPR-compliant and legally secure, you can sign around 85% of all contracts.</b></a></h3>
<p>Any contracts can be signed with the blockchain based INHUBBER signature. Contracts like:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rental contracts</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Purchase contracts</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Employment contracts for an unlimited period etc.<br /></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two-factor authentication is provided by means of a password and a security key. Unlike the competition, the INHUBBER signature can sign any file format. For example, Excel spreadsheets, videos, photos, but also complete folders such as zip folders can be signed. INHUBBER also offers the highest security level for signing contracts. The contracts themselves do not leave INHUBBER&#8217;s encrypted storage. Instead, the invited signatories receive a &#8220;key&#8221; to the repository where the contracts are located. Thus, our users always have a DSGVO-compliant secure solution when working with their contracts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Secure, fast and simple digital contract signing with the help of blockchain technology makes everyday work easier. Regardless of the file format, blockchain technology ensures maximum auditability and transparency during the entire signature process. Sign as many contracts as you like and always keep an overview, as every contract change is documented fully automatically and stored in a tamper-proof manner.</span></p>
<h3><a href="https://www.aosphere.com/aos/e-signature?gclid=CjwKCAjw-qeFBhAsEiwA2G7Nl-0jIXcg2X-U-67IIq5j9CRce5YctS7wqgz-VyeaC2r6yfnkAz6IKRoCT6EQAvD_BwE"><b>What about the international legal validity of the digital signature?</b></a></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital signatures are now legally recognised in many countries around the world. However, there is no internationally uniform standard as there is for the EU countries. Companies doing business internationally must therefore deal with the legislation in the individual target countries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A distinction is usually made between generous, two-tier and restrictive legislation. This means that in some countries with very generous legislation, such as Australia and Canada, simple digital signatures enjoy the same status as handwritten signatures. In some cases, however, the parties must have agreed to the use of digital signatures in advance, in the traditional way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In restrictive national legislations, the digital signature is subject to strict country-specific laws that often do not legally recognise simple digital signatures. In the USA, the ESIGN Act was passed to ensure the validity of electronic signatures for the whole of America. It states that a contract cannot be declared invalid because of its electronic signature.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The eIDAS regulation was designed on the basis of existing global standards for electronic signatures and regulates much more than is required internationally. Therefore, a qualified digital signature according to eIDAS is usually also recognised internationally. But in individual cases, one has to look at each country individually.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A better chance of legal certainty can also be achieved by moving the place of jurisdiction for international contracts to the state in which the requirements for concluding a contract by electronic signature are less stringent.</span></p>
<h4><b>What do companies have to consider in order for the signature to be legally valid?</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All parties involved must agree in a binding manner that they agree to use this form of signature. This is done with a form clause. This could look like this, for example: &#8220;If you proceed, you agree that both parties will execute the agreement with an electronic signature.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is important that all steps leading to the signature are documented and recorded. Then, if necessary, the process can be proven in a later court case.  This can be ensured with blockchain technology for transparent tracking.</span></p>
<h3><b>How do I prove the contract in court?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two points are particularly important for this. Firstly, the agreed form clause must be presented, showing that the conclusion of the contract was requested electronically. Secondly, the contracting party must be able to show that the parties signed the contracts electronically and that the form was observed. An advanced electronic signature, as provided by INHUBBER, is always better in any case if disputes arise later.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The digital signature saves valuable time. A digital signature shortens the time between agreeing the terms of the lease and actually signing the lease. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Electronic signatures are not only a good solution, they are also an absolutely secure way to sign the contract, because the processes are 100% controlled by INHUBBER. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For fixed rents, a simple or advanced digital signature is permitted. However, for contracts with staggered rents, the law requires a qualified electronic signature with an identity check. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use the digital signature when renting flats or commercial properties to private or corporate clients.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Surely you agree with us: &#8220;Print, sign and scan&#8221; is annoying and you can do it better. That&#8217;s why digital document management now replaces the stacks of paper on your desk. With INHUBBER, you can process your documents digitally in a simple and legally secure way, save resources and do something for the environment at the same time.</span></p>
<h4><b>Today&#8217;s state of affairs with many landlords</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A potential tenant is interested in a flat or a corporate client in a commercial property. The tenant makes contact and is interviewed in the next step. Then he will visit the property. In the course of the conversation, you then ask for his identity card, write down the necessary data, and refer to the fact that you will get in touch with him.</span></p>
<h4><b>This is how the process could work in the future (digital signature rental):</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A customer expresses interest in a flat and then receives a request for a self-disclosure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The tenant receives the information in the workflow and decides whether and when viewing can take place. After a positive visit, the employee gives the contract department the order to add the contract to the customer&#8217;s digital workflow with the data previously generated by the customer. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new tenant signs digitally using his digital signature, all of which costs the tenant nothing and is digital throughout. After the signature, the accounting department receives the information to obtain the SEPA direct debit authorisation, also via the workflow, deposit regulations can be individually defined in the process. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the end of the digital process, the caretaker receives the task of handing over the flat to the tenant and sends the digital handover protocol.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The tenant can complete all of this from anywhere using a tablet that the employee presents to him or his own mobile phone, tablet, PC or Mac. Finally, the contract parts are &#8220;signed&#8221; electronically in a legally secure way, according to the valid elDAS law. This process saves you time and costs the client nothing! </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">INHUBBER guarantees that the data cannot be changed afterwards. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, we offer you a highly secure and cloud-based solution, in a German data centre, and with the necessary security certifications. This means maximum security for your company. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sales representative has the possibility to see when and how often the customer opened the contract until he signed it. Here it could be defined that after 3 days an automatic request is sent again to sign the contract.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inhubber can automatically recognise and highlight information from contracts, such as deadlines. You may avoid transmission errors and process costs can be greatly reduced as staff time is spent on creating, sending, tracking, merging and handling documents. This allows your staff to concentrate on what really matters: the customer and their care.</span></p>
<h4>INHUBBER offers artificial intelligence for your leases</h4>
<p>INHUBBER&#8217;s artificial intelligence can automatically recognise and highlight information from contracts, such as deadlines and termination dates. You can avoid transcription errors, if necessary, and process costs can be greatly reduced, as staff can spend time creating, sending, tracking, merging and handling documents. This allows your employees to concentrate on what is really important, the customer.</p>
<h4><strong>Hardware and software requirements.</strong></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New implementations often fail due to organisational hurdles, such as the installation of new software or the purchase of various hardware components. This is not necessary with our solution! Inhubber offers an immediately available solution! Whether from a mobile phone or a PC, you can start immediately.</span></p>

<h4><b>Digital tenancy agreement another step on the way to complete, digital leasing</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The digitalisation of processes in the real estate industry has made great strides in recent years and has led to faster and more convenient work processes for portfolio owners and property managers. The letting process has also already been digitalised in detail at most housing companies &#8211; but usually not across the board.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While work steps such as marketing the flat, coordinating viewing appointments and communicating with prospective tenants are often already carried out digitally, the rental contract is still concluded in the traditional way. Although the digital conclusion of the contract is the logical continuation of a digital and efficient letting process, there were legal hurdles that prevented the use of an electronic signature for the rental contract.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The handwritten signature under a rental contract is done quickly, but the contract preparation and appointment coordination tie up valuable human resources. Even for the appointment of signing the contract itself, the responsible employee has to block at least 30 minutes of his time. Some landlords are already resorting to sending contracts by post in order to minimise their workload. However, sending contracts by post also has its pitfalls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the one hand, there is the risk of contract revocation, as it can be a distance selling transaction. On the other hand, the process usually takes 11 to 14 days &#8211; from drafting the rental contract, to signing it with several parties, to archiving it. </span></p>
<h4><b>Legal hurdles</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The benefits of digitally signing leases are clear, but legal problems have prevented its use so far. By law, tenancy agreements do not need to be in writing and are therefore already legally binding with a simple electronic signature. This would be the case, for example, if the contract is sent as a PDF and the tenant inserts his signature as an image. However, this simple electronic signature does not usually stand up in court as evidence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to achieve a level of security comparable to that of a handwritten signature, a so-called advanced electronic signature is necessary, such as that offered by INHUBBER. This leads to a reversal of the burden of proof and, if combined with a strong identification procedure, the advanced electronic signature represents a secure means of proof.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An electronic signature can reduce the signature process to a few hours. At the same time, printing and postage costs are saved and the environment is also protected. The electronic signature offers advantages especially for landlords. Here, printing costs are eliminated and the completely digital document can be digitally archived in optimal quality without scanning.</span></p>
<h4><b>The legally secure digital tenancy agreement with Inhubber</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">INHUBBER’s digital tenancy agreement signature has successfully overcome these legal hurdles and provides a legally secure electronic signature for tenancy agreements.</span></p>
<h4><b>Ease of use</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the landlord side, top priority was given to ease of use without additional logins. As soon as all tenants have signed the contract, the authorised signatories receive an e-mail with the request to sign. The process can be started with a click from the email and also requires no identification. If desired, landlords can also set it to sign in front of the tenants. After each party has signed, the completed contract document is sent to all signatories via email link.</span></p>
<h4><strong>Integration into existing infrastructure</strong></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The digital tenancy agreement signature is set up as an independent module, so that landlords who do not use the Inhubber software or have never been in contact with it can also use the digital tenancy agreement. INHUBBER&#8217;s signature platform does not provide contract templates, but allows landlords to upload their own contracts and have them digitally signed and signed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>With Inhubber, it is now possible to digitally encrypt the leasing process end-to-end without compromising on legal security</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Secure, fast and simple digital contract signatures with the help of blockchain technology will make your everyday work easier from now on. Regardless of the file format, blockchain technology ensures maximum auditability and transparency during the entire signature process. Sign as many contracts as you like and always keep an overview, as every contract change is documented fully automatically.</span></p>
